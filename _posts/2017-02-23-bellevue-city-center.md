### Bellevue City Center Plaza

Today, I got to meet my team and visit our building. Everyone is super friendly, but understandably busy. I'll get a chance to chat with them more next week during a team lunch. We are all located on the 19th floor. I can see Valve's office across the courtyard of City Center.


I never thought I would be working out of a high rise. I decided to explore the rest of the building. I discovered ping pong tables on the floors above and below mine. There's a 24/7 self-serve market on floor 14. The cafe is located on floor 25.

### Cafe

The cafe in City Center has less choices, but the salad bar is fully stocked. The view is incredible.

### Board Game Night

I joined a board game group (for Microsoft employees) that meets every Thursday in my building. They have been meeting for years and everyone was super friendly. I learned how to play [7 Wonders](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders) and [Secret Hitler](http://www.secrethitler.com/). I had a great time learning the games and making new friends! I'll definitely be meeting up with this group again.
