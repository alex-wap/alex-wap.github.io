### Another Sunrise

I woke up early again and snapped this photo. It's a beautiful horizon to wake up to and I feel very lucky.

### Laptop

We finally got our laptops. I'll have to relearn Windows, but it shouldn't be too bad. I spent most of the last 5 years using a PC. The laptop is a Lenovo ThinkPad P40 Yoga i7 with 16 GB RAM (2-in-1 with touchscreen/stylus). It's a bit heavy, but it's powerful and the screen is beautiful. Maybe I'll post some of my notes using the stylus in a later post.


### View from my Window

Here is my view at 5 PM.

### Marymoor Park

I live half a mile away from Marymoor Park, which is the largest and oldest park in King County. It's 640 acres big and gets over 3 million visitors a year. When the weather is nice, it's filled with people and their dogs.
