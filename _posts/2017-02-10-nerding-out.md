### Din Tai Fung (Bellevue) 


I went to DTF in the Philippines, but I never went to one in America. This location is in a mall and I got super lucky. The first wave of customers at the bar finished as I arrived (no wait). I got their famous Steamed Truffle & Pork Xiao Long Baos as well as their standard ones. Pricey, but worth it. I doubt I'll make it over here again unless I end up in one of the Bellevue offices.

### Valve 

I emailed the front desk in the morning asking for a tour, but I did not receive a response. I decided to try my luck and wait in the lobby. I got very lucky (my tour guide's code was compiling, so he had time to show me around). I could not take photos in most parts of the tour, but I did get a nifty picture of a motion detecting sentry from TF2 as well as the valve in the lobby. I also spotted Gabe, but he was busy preparing for his [press conference](http://cybbet.com/news/3560-Gabe-Newell-The-International-2017-is-likely-to-move-Trump-and-his-decree--the-main-reason). My tour guide (software developer at Valve since 2005) also talked about how there are [three new VR games](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/291222) being developed and that **"three is a good number"**. Awesome tour, thanks Kerry!

### Microsoft

I went to the Microsoft Visitor Center. I checked out the Hololens (display case only) and the Surface Studio (fun to play with). There was a huge statue of Master Chief outside of the MS Store. I also took a selfie with young Bill Gates (not shown).

### Weekend Plans

I'm going to visit the Future of Flight Aviation Center & Boeing Tour. I will also meet up with some Cal grads who live in the Seattle area. C# is also on my list.
