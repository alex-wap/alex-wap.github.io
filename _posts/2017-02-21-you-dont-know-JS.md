### Badge & Mission

I finally got my badge today! Microsoft's mission appears on the back of everyone's badge. It says:


> Empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. 


I'm definitely in the honeymoon phase with my new job, but it's a great mission statement and I wholeheartedly agree with it. :)

I'm excited to explore the corners of campus I haven't seen it. I saw this ridiculous flask in the MS store.

### Kyle Simpson

I drove over to Dev Bootcamp in Seattle with some coworkers to hear a talk from Kyle Simpson, the author of the **free** book series [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS). He is really knowledgeable and his presentation was excellent. 


The main topic of the talk was about JavaScript ES6 and his programming philosophy. Declarative programming is preferable to imperative programming. What does that mean?


[Declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) is focused on the outcome rather than the exact method of achieving that outcome. As a programmer, I care about *what* the program accomplishes versus *how* it accomplishes it. The classic example is map functions. We don't need to see exactly how it's done, but we know what we want as output when we write this function.


[Imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) is the opposite of declarative programming. The focus is on the process and *how* the program achieves the desired outcome. An example of this would be explicit iteration in a for loop.


The talk showcased using new ES6 features to improve code readability. It was super cool to hear Kyle's take on each ES6 feature and his general opinions about JavaScript. He also made a great point about semicolons. He argues that developers should put in semicolons because it improves readability. This seems counterintuitive because we are adding characters. Semicolons mark the end of each statement. Therefore, we are able to read and understand the code more easily thanks to knowing when a statment is compelete (rather than searching the next line for a semicolon). 


I look forward to attending more talks in the near future.

### Window

The forecast says snow tomorrow and it's definitely dreary.
