### Cafe 83

Now that everyone got a badge, we decided to explore a nearby cafe. There were lots of interesting options. They have one station for seasonal and local fresh seafood, which offered a surf and turf for $11 and also a fish and chips featuring salmon. Another station uses local cheese and house-roasted meats to make fancy sandwiches. We opted for the free-range chicken station. I'll definitely come back to this cafe and it's a great one to show off to visitors.

### Building 83

Cafe 83 is located in Microsoft Building 83 (surprise!). It was originally owned by Safeco and it has a super modern design. Fancy chairs and glass conference rooms that hover over the four story atrium.

### Microsoft Logo

A few of us wanted to explore the Microsoft library, which is located near the visitor's center. We took a photo with another Microsoft logo. :)

### Microsoft Library

This "library" was really disappointing. It's a single floor and very small. It had a nice display case full of interesting things like an original xbox, candid photos of Bill Gates, and a super old Macintosh.

### Exploring Campus

I decided to continue my self-tour of campus. I caught a nice sunset on my walk and found another Master Chief. :)
