### Events

One of my main career goals is to expand and improve my professional network. I decided that one of the best ways to meet people is to go to Meetups and events. Here's a quick summary of some of the groups and events that I have attended over the last month.

### [Office 365 Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/O365Seattle/)

The Office 365 Meetup group is hosted and sponsored by Microsoft. They provide free food and host multiple presentations/speakers. I was able to snag a free shirt (via raffle)! After the talks, everyone goes to the Boardwalk (at the Microsoft Commons) and participates in "Sharepint". What is "Sharepint"? It's an open tab that is named after [Sharepoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/). :)

### You Don't Know JS - Kyle Simpson

This was a talk by Kyle Simpson, who created the [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) series. He is super knowledgeable about JavaScript/ES6 and gave a great talk. I highly recommend his series if you want to increase your JavaScript proficiency and depth.

### Amazon Happy Hour

This event (ticketed by Eventbrite) had awesome food and drinks, but was really just a recruiting event. They had multiple recruiters floating around and writing down people's contact information. They hosted a trivia game using Amazon statistics and gave out $25 gift cards. I met some other Microsoft employees there as well as a Software Architect at Boeing.

### [Windows Holographic User Group](https://www.meetup.com/WinHUGR/)

This Meetup is awesome. The members are super passionate about developing experiences and applications for AR/VR, but more specifically for HoloLens. I got to try the HoloLens for the first time. I was blown away by the accuracy of the room mapping and it feels very novel. Unfortuntely, the field of view is quite low. This forces the user to turn their head instead of being able to use peripheral vision. I was still very impressed as this is the first publicly released iteration of the device. I can't wait to see what's next for HoloLens.
