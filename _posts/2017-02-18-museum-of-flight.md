### Museum of Flight

The Museum of Flight is one of the top attractions in Seattle on Trip Advisor, but it was also recommended to me by someone at a MSFT Meetup. It's awesome.

My favorite plane at the museum is the M-21 Blackbird. It's an incredible piece of history and technology. The Blackbird's body stretches several inches during flight due to high temperatures. Wow.

### Flashback

My mom found photos of me at the museum in 1994. I don't remember the visit, but it was amazing to see the same blackbird 20+ years later.
