### Capitol Hill

I explored Capitol Hill with my coworkers today. We hit up Elysian Brewery (I love the Space Dust IPA) and a Caribbean cocktail bar called Rumba. They had awesome empanadas. We then explored the Starbucks Roastery and Hot Cakes.

### Starbucks Roastery

Wow, what a fancy coffee shop. It reminds me of Ghirardelli Square Chocolate Factory. Apparently they have a flight of coffee which I'll have to get next time (it was way too late in the night to have coffee). I figured out how to convert my LIVE photo from my phone into a gfycat. Enjoy!

### Hot Cakes

What an incredibly rich dessert. My heart was pounding out of my chest from the sugar rush. This is totally worth checking out if you're a big chocolate fan.
