### Reddit + Microsoft 

[Alexis Ohanian](http://alexisohanian.com/) is one of Reddit's cofounders and he came to speak at Microsoft! There's a Reddit + Microsoft partnership in the works, so he gave an overview of what Reddit is and what their goals are. His presentation was full of stories from Reddit (including references to [r/Blep](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blep/) and [Shitty_Watercolour](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shitty_Watercolour/)). He also made a Google/Bing joke. Heh.

### Pull Request Approve and Completed

I've been working on a new feature for almost two weeks. I would say that I completed a basic version of the feature within a couple days, but the hard part was actually integrating it into the existing product. It was a great learning experience. 


A thorough code review with a senior developer helped me learn a ton in a very short period of time. I blasted through a lot of coding today thanks to the comments and suggestions by the senior dev. I was able to wrap up my code and submit it for testing. I'm expecting a lot of work to iterate and improve the existing solution, but I'm happy that my coworkers will see the results of my work.
