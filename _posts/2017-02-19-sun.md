### Code Fellows

I didn't take any photos at Code Fellows, but it's a beautiful and sprawling working space. They have tons of whiteboards, whiteboard desks, a ping pong table, an office putter, a basketball minigame, giant connect four, giant janga, and kegs of beer. I finally got to play a little ping pong, which I have missed since leaving California.

### Window

The sun was out for a bit. :)
