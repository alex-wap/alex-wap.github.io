### Code Fellows

Code Fellows has a beautiful and sprawling working space. They have tons of whiteboards, whiteboard desks, a ping pong table, an office putter, a basketball minigame, giant connect four, giant janga, and kegs of beer. I finally got to play a little ping pong, which I have missed since leaving California. Here's a candid from our study session.

The sun was out for a bit. :)
