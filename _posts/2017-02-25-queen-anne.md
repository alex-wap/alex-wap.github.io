### ORCA Card

Microsoft provides free ORCA (One Regional Card for All) cards. It's used by all public transportion options in the Puget Sound region of Washington State. ORCA is similar to the Clipper Card in the Bay Area.


Parking in Seattle is obscene, so I decided to park my car in Bellevue for free and then take the bus with a friend across the bridge. It took about 30 minutes and it was totally painless. We decided to walk from University Street Station to Kerry Park. We spent about an hour walking past Pike Place, the Space Needle, Key Arena, and finally climbing a giant hill up to Kerry Park.


### Kerry Park

This is a tiny park, but the view is  killer. If you have seen a postcard from Seattle, this is essentially the same view. When the weather is clear, I've been told that Mount Rainier is in the background. Here's my modest photo. These are the types of spots that are made for DSLRs.

### Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream

Molly Moon's is Seattle's answer to Ici Ice Cream in Berkeley and Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco. Sorry, more food photos. I went with Grapefruit Rosemary Sorbet with Lemon Curd as a topping in a waffle cone.

Molly Moon's ice cream is great, however Ici's cones are superior. We sat in shop for about 20 minutes and all our clothes smelled of waffle cones for the rest of the day. 


### Window

The weather was super nice when I woke up, however it will rain for the next 7+ days.
