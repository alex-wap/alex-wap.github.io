### Seattle Ferry

I've been waiting for good weather to take the ferry across the Puget Sound. It was raining earlier in the day, but the clouds parted and the sun came out. The cherry blossoms are blooming now that it's Spring.

### Bainbridge Island

Bainbridge Island is a small island west of Seattle. It's home to a quaint city that is much like Sausalito, California. We walked around, grabbed gelato, and found some cool rock sculptures.
