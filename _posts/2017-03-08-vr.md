### CSS Tables

I don't enjoy writing CSS in general, but I encountered an interesting challenge at work. Without going into detail, I needed to build a mobile responsive group of elements. My original solution used Twitter Bootstrap's row divs to layout my elements. Eventually, I realized that my data was better displayed as a table.


After I refactored my elements into a table, I encountered another problem. As I resized the window, the elements would wrap and create an extra row of elements. My first row would be split into two rows, which was not what I wanted. I spent a bunch of time searching Bing (maybe it was on an "alternative search engine") for a solution. I ended up going with property I had never heard of: white-space. I used the table row selector `tr` and applied `white-space: nowrap;`. This solution stopped my rows from wrapping. Neat!


### Solution


Ultimately, I had to change my approach. My goal was to show the entire table and allow the user to zoom in as desired. The `tr{white-space: nowrap;}` solution clipped the end of the table from the screen and required scrolling to view. Not a great user experience. I decided to scale each element using vw units (which is new in CSS3). What is a vw unit? 1 unit represents 1/100th of the viewport width. This unit is great for mobile responsive design because the width changes with the size of the viewport. Yay!


### My First VR Experience


I had extra time before an Amazon event, so I decided to visit the Microsoft store to test out their Vive setup. My expectations were pretty high, but I was still impressed by some of the experiences.

The structure of the data gives me a peek into the design decisions they made. The naming conventions as well as their resource handling was fun to piece together. It was an interesting exercise to traverse an unfamiliar API (without looking at the documentation). Now, I'll read the documentation to learn more.
