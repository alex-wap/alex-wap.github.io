### CSS Tables

I don't enjoy writing CSS in general, but I encountered an interesting challenge at work. Without going into detail, I needed to build a mobile responsive group of elements. My original solution used Twitter Bootstrap's row divs to layout my elements. Eventually, I realized that my data was better displayed as a table.


After I refactored my elements into a table, I encountered another problem. As I resized the window, the elements would wrap and create an extra row of elements. My first row would be split into two rows, which was not what I wanted. I spent a bunch of time searching Bing (maybe it was on an "alternative search engine") for a solution. I ended up going with property I had never heard of: white-space. I used the table row selector `tr` and applied `white-space: nowrap;`. This solution prevented my rows from wrapping. 

Ultimately, I had to change my approach.

### My First VR Experience


I can't talk about what outside service I'm working with, but the service provider's API is unreleased and "in beta". It has some missing features (that are critical for my project) and a really odd JSON structure. I spent a significant amount of time traversing through the JSON data and exploring the API.

The structure of the data gives me a peek into the design decisions they made. The naming conventions as well as their resource handling was fun to piece together. It was an interesting exercise to traverse an unfamiliar API (without looking at the documentation). Now, I'll read the documentation to learn more.
