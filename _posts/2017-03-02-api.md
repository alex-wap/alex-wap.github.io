### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

I'll provide a quick introduction to an Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Please skip this paragraph if you already know what an API is. An API is a way for software programs to interact with each other. In the context of web development, APIs allow developers to access data from various websites/services to use for their own applications. The developer is given a set of rules (usually through documentation) and those rules dictate the what and how to use the service. If the service is providing data, it is most commonly in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

### API Service Provider


I can't talk about what outside service I'm working with, but the service provider's API is unreleased and "in beta". It has some missing features (that are critical for my project) and a really odd JSON structure. I spent a significant amount of time traversing through the JSON data and exploring the API.


The structure of the data gives me a peek into the design decisions they made. The naming conventions as well as their resource handling was fun to piece together. It was a fun and interesting exercise to traverse an unfamiliar API (without looking at the documentation).
