### Last Day of LEAP Classroom

Today was the last day of the classroom training portion of my program. Starting on Monday, we will all be reporting to our sponsoring teams full-time. This is great because we will get more experience working as Software Engineers, but it's also bittersweet. LEAP provides a great sense of community and really gives us ties to other people within Microsoft, which is a huge organization. I'll try to stay in touch with everyone, but it will be much harder as we are in different buildings and campuses. We took a couple photos as a group before heading out to enjoy our weekends.
