### Snow?! ❄️

I woke up to the sight of snowfall through my window. There was snow on the ground when I first arrived in the Puget Sound area, but the storm had already passed. It has snowed twice in the past three weeks in the area. The last time it snowed in the Seattle area was 2014. There are a lot of hills around my Airbnb, so I decided not to risk the drive. I ended up walking to work during a snowfall. I don't like the cold, but I loved my walk to work today. The snow muffles a lot of the typical noise, which makes the world seem a little more magical.
