I had extra time before an Amazon event, so I went to test out the Vive setup at the Microsoft store. I have used Google Cardboard before, but I do not consider it a full VR experience. My expectations were pretty high, but I was still impressed by how novel the experiences were. The store uses various demos to showcase the Vive. The first demo helps you visualize the amount of physical space you can use. It also helps you get familiar with the controllers. Here's a photo of me trying it out (thanks Tara):
