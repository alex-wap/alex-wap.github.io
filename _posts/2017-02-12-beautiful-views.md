### Before the Storm

It was an amazing clearly day. I decided to scope out some of the best views on the Eastside.

### Newcastle Golf Course

I decided to drive up to the Newcastle Golf Course. It was about 25 minutes of driving along Lake Sammamish. The view was breathtaking. My iPhone 6s couldn't do it justice, but here's the photo anyway.

### Sunset Mission

I visited the Seattle Coding Dojo location (in part for the free parking) and spoke with a few people about BSTs. I then wanted to find a good spot to take a sunset shot. I tried a couple buildings that required keycards (by tailgating juuuuuust a little), but I couldn't get to a nice vantage point. Ultimately, I found Daniel's Broiler, which is on the 21st floor attached to the Hyatt in Bellevue. They graciously let me take a photo without having to dine there ($$$).

### View from my Window

Best view I'll get during my stay most likely.

### LEAP

Tomorrow is my first day at Microsoft. I'm excited to learn and meet some cool people! Hopefully my posts will be more about code instead of a picture book.
