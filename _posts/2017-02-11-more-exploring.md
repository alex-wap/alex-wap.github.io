### Good to Go WSDOT (rant warning, skip this section)

Apparently the bridge between Seattle and East Lake (Bellevue/Redmond) charges you in both directions. If you don't buy into their system, they will charge you an extra $2 each time to pay by mail. To be in their system, you have to buy a $5 sticker and the account minimum is $30 and it will automatically recharge your account if you go below $8. I don't agree with those limits, but I joined their system anyway.

### Boeing Tour

The Boeing tour is approximately 30 minutes north of Redmond. It was a beautiful day and I enjoyed looking at the engines up close. Fun fact, the engines aren't manufactured by Boeing. Most of what Boeing does is assembly work, not manufacturing. They have the largest building (by volume) in the world. Pretty cool. I thought the SpaceX tour was more interesting, but this one was still impressive.

### Microsoft

I ended up talking to someone next to me on the bus to get to the Boeing tour. He told me his name, his job title, and approximately how long he's been working there. Later that day, I was able to find him on LinkedIn within 5 minutes of searching. Kinda creepy, but also kinda cool. Technology!

### View from my Window

I'll try to post daily photos from my window if I can. I've experienced amazing weather here so far, but it will start raining again on Wednesday.

### Cal Alumni

I met up with some Cal alums at a dive bar in Greenwood (North of Fremont / the Fremont Troll). One of my fraternity brothers is from the area and I got all his pro tips (b&w to hide the red).
