### Windows Laptop

I have used Windows computers for the vast majority of my professional career, however it was always with a full-size keyboard and mouse. I have a great laptop overall, but I must say the trackpad leaves a lot to be desired. Apple trackpads are by far the best feeling and best performing in the industry. If you know of a great PC trackpad, please tell me! 


The location of the page up and page down keys is logical, but I'm constantly hitting them while trying to use arrow keys to navigate. Ugh. I'll get used to it eventually (or use an external keyboard). The true challenge is learning  new muscle memory for the windows commands.


### Visual Studio

There are a lot of things to like about Visual Studio. The autocomplete feature is very robust. You can even create "summaries" for the objects you create (classes, methods, variables, etc) that will appear in the tooltips as you write the rest of your code. I enjoy pressing F5 to compile and run my programs, but a lot of the keyboard shortcuts seems slower. Commenting out some code requires two keystrokes (Control+K, Control+C) as does uncommenting code (Control+K, Control+U). Smart indenting also requires two keystrokes (Control+K, Control+F).


I think Visual Studio is **way** better than Xcode. Maybe it was the Macbook Air's hardware constraints, but I had lots of crashes with Xcode **daily**. I haven't seen Visual Studio crash yet. It feels a lot more performant and I'm enjoying it.


Coming from Swift, I find C# to be fairly easy and straightforward. I'll go over it in a different blog post.

### Bone Marrow

I'll try to keep my food posts to a minimum, but I have a soft spot for bone marrow. This was at [Woodblock](http://www.woodblockredmond.com/), where they also do whiskey flights. I'm definitely coming back to this place. :)

### Window

This view will never get old.
