### Before Work

The fog killed my bedroom view as I prepped for my 20 minute walking commute.

### LEAP

The first day was really just to meet everyone, sort through some logistics, and do some Q&A. I asked the hard-hitting questions such as "where is the closest ping pong table?" All my cohort mates were super friendly and I'm excited to learn alongside so many talented and interesting individuals. There were a lot more Bay Area people than I was expecting. One guy came all the way from Michigan and told us the story of how he *almost* became a professional laser tag player. It's seriously not a joke, he shared some of his techniques and I was convinced. We are all super excited to be here for this opportunity. Here's a photo of some of us.

### IPG

At the end of the day, we got to see which teams were sponsoring us. It was done using the Harry Potter sorting hat. When I opened up the paper, I read my team out loud: "Information Platform Group". I had never heard of this group before. I didn't know how to feel about it. After some research, I discovered that IPG is responsible for the tech behind Cortana and Bing (two teams I was interested in joining). That's awesome. From Microsoft's website:


> The IPG division provides the platform and AI behind Bing, Cortana and many other smart experiences across Microsoft. The team is working on next generation platform and machine learning capabilities that will power revolutionary experiences that are smart and personalized to the user and their context. These experiences will allow users to do more and be more in a hyper connected and informed world. In a nutshell, the information platform forms the basis of how we will build intelligent applications and services, leveraging breakthroughs in large scale distributed systems, big data and machine learning.


Yeah, that's awesome. I'm super excited to meet my sponsoring team, learn as much as I can, write great software, and immerse myself in tech!

Day one complete!


### View from my Window

The fog cleared out and the view from my window showed another sunny day. :)
