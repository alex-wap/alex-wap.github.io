### Sunrise

I am normally a late riser, however this morning I woke up and snagged a shot of the sunrise from my window before climbing back into bed.

### Git and GitHub

In the morning we had a lecture on Git and GitHub. Our presenter gave out his [GitHub and slides](https://github.com/paulmey/learngit). I'm pretty confident in my ability to use GitHub, but I was happy to ask the lecturer a specific question: 

> **"If I make changes to some files on a server instance, how do I keep those changes through a git pull from GitHub? Should I use `git stash` or `git checkout -- <file>`?"**


In Django, there is a settings.py file that you need to update with the IP address of your instance. One way to solve this is to use the .gitignore file and add settings.py to it. You can either create the file directly on the instance or add it to .gitignore after your initial clone and git pull after. This method totally works, but I wanted to find out a different way.


The other way to solve this is to use `git stash`. This command stores your changes which you can later apply. The idea is this: you changed your settings file, but you need to update another part of your application. You work locally on your computer, commit and push it to your GitHub, then from your instance git pull. Once you have the local changes into your instance, you can run `git stash pop`, which applies server changes (the settings.py file in this example) and then removes the stash.


This is what the procedure would look like step-by-step: 

1. SSH into your instance: update your files (such as settings.py with the IP address of your instance)
2. `git stash`
3. Switch to your terminal window for your computer.
4. make changes locally on your computer
5. `git add .`
6. `git commit -m "COMMIT MSG"`
7. `git push origin master` (get your changes on github)
8. SSH into your instance: `git pull` (from your instance, get your changes onto your instance)
9. `git stash pop` (throws away the stash after applying it)
10. The changes you made on the instance will merge with the updates you made locally.


I updated my [Git Guide](https://github.com/alex-wap/gitguide) repo with these steps.


### Collaboration on GitHub


I also wanted to touch on another thing I learned today. When you fork a project for collaboration, there are two ways to set up your git remotes. I typically fork, git clone my fork, and set up remote upstream as the main project url. With this method, you `git pull upstream master` whenever there is an update to the main repo. You `git push origin master` to update your forked GitHub version.


The other way is this (slightly more concise): fork, git clone the main project (not your version), and set up remote "me" with your forked GitHub repo. This lets you do `git pull` for updates and `git push me` to update your GitHub repo. I added this method to my [Git Guide](https://github.com/alex-wap/gitguide) as well.


### What's Next?

Tomorrow, we will go over Operating Systems and some Lua.


### View from my Window

Maybe the last sunny window I'll see here. :(
