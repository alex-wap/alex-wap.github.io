### Morale Event

Higher employee morale equals more productivity, collaboration, and rentention. Every team at Microsoft is given a budget to use for morale events. Our team's committee decided on [Whirlyball](http://whirlyballseattle.com/). Whirlyball is described as bumper cars meets lacrosse meets basketball. Teams use scoopers to fling whiffle balls at targets that look like basketball hoops. It was really silly and I enjoyed my time playing. Here's a picture of the team members who attended (it's super blurry unfortunately):

My team ended up winning the "tournament". We got free shirts along with a bottle of extremely cheap (awful) champagne. Overall, it was a fun way to break up the day. :)
