### The Coding Interview

One of the most challenging aspects of building a career in software development is the coding interview. Job seekers will encounter problems testing their knowledge of algorithms and data structures. I am constantly improving my whiteboarding abilities. I decided to organize a group among the LEAP (both current and former) members to practice our ability to whiteboard. I'll post about the problems we solve. I created a GitHub repo as well [here](https://github.com/alex-wap/interview-prep).


We picked a bad day to study because it was incredibly sunny. Evidence below:

### Window 

The sun shows itself again. :)
